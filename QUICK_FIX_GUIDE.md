# Quick Fix Guide - "Not Found" Issue (v2.7.7)

## TL;DR - What Was Fixed

Your California Legal Citation Validator was showing all citations as "Not Found" even though the API was working perfectly. This was caused by:

1. ❌ HTTP client not initializing properly  
2. ❌ Timeout too short for multiple citations
3. ❌ Circuit breaker blocking retries
4. ❌ No diagnostic logging to troubleshoot

**All fixed in v2.7.7!** ✅

## What Changed

### Before (v2.7.6)
```
⚠️ Unverified Citations (4):
CCP § 1005   → ⚠️ Not Found
CCP § 1013   → ⚠️ Not Found
FAM § 245    → ⚠️ Not Found
CCP § 1010   → ⚠️ Not Found
```

### After (v2.7.7)
```
✓ Verified Citations (4):
CCP § 1005   → ✓ Verified (3656 chars)
CCP § 1013   → ✓ Verified (5974 chars)
FAM § 245    → ✓ Verified (907 chars)
CCP § 1010   → ✓ Verified (751 chars)
```

## Key Improvements

| Feature | Before (v2.7.6) | After (v2.7.7) |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| HTTP Init Check | ❌ Silent failure | ✅ Explicit validation + error logging |
| Timeout | ⏱️ Fixed 5s total | ⏱️ 5s per citation (capped at 30s) |
| API Test | ❌ None | ✅ Connectivity test on startup |
| Diagnostics | ⚠️ Generic errors | ✅ Detailed logging at every step |
| Circuit Breaker | 🔴 No visibility | ✅ State logged when blocking |

## Installation

Simply replace your current filter with the updated `legal_citation_validator.py` file and restart Open WebUI.

## Verification

After installing v2.7.7, you should see in logs:

```
🔧 California Legal Citation Validator v2.7.7 - STARTING UP
[INIT] Testing API connectivity...
[INIT] ✓ API connectivity verified (HTTP 200)
✓ HTTP client initialized for https://www.codecond.com/api/v2
```

Then test with: **"what does CCP 1005 say?"**

Expected output should include:
- **CCP § 1005 ✓** (with checkmark)
- Full section text displayed
- Verification summary showing "✓ Verified"

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Not Found"?

**Check 1**: Look for this in logs:
```
[API INIT] FAILED - HTTP client still None after on_startup()
```
→ **Fix**: Restart Open WebUI

**Check 2**: Look for this in logs:
```
[API BLOCKED] Circuit breaker OPEN
```
→ **Fix**: Wait 60 seconds or restart filter

**Check 3**: Look for this in logs:
```
[API FETCH] ✗ TIMEOUT after 30s
```
→ **Fix**: Increase `api_timeout_seconds` valve to 10

**Check 4**: Test API directly:
```bash
curl https://www.codecond.com/api/v2/codes/CCP/sections/1005
```
If this fails → network/firewall issue
